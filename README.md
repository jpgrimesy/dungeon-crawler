### Description

This MERN stack app, styled with Tailwind, was to initially created to allow users to sign up, sign in and create dungeon and dragon characters. It serves as a place to able to pull up all the necessary information needed for gameplay.

Due to time constraints, the app is currently just meant to show full CRUD within the application with creating a character. The original idea was to create an app to give dungeon masters all the tools they need to deliver smooth fluid gameplay and have all the information they need readily available on their screen.
